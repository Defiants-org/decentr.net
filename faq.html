          <h3>Q. When do you estimate Decentr’s open alpha will be ready?</h3>
          <p>Assuming successful token sale by Q4 2019, we could have open alpha by as early as Q3 2020, as we have already proven core backend tech.
          </p>

          <h3>Q. What is the relationship between PDV and DecID?</h3>
          <p>Personal Data Value (PDV) is the economic expression of the securely recorded online activity on your DecID. Only you can access this data. Only you can choose what your data is used for and who has access to it: private, semi-private, public, it is up to you.</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. Why does secure data have more value than non-secure data?</h3>
          <p>Secure data is valuable because it is immutable and tamperproof, and that value on Decentr is expressed as an economic value that is yours to pay and trade. Basically, immutable and tamperproof data has the same (or superior) “value store” properties as “money”; i.e., it can function as a stable, expression of exchangeable and fungible value between buyer and seller. </p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. So what do I pay with: my PDV or do I pay with my DecID?</h3>
          <p>Neither! This is the beauty of the system: your PDV fluctuates, depending on engagement, in the same way as a standard currency “exchange rate”. So when you want to pay for something on Decentr, your dWallet will support a range of crypts and fiat (including Dec) and you can pay with whatever currency you like. However, here’s the cool part, this payment will be made at a personal “exchange rate” dictated by your PDV to Dec. Here’s a simple example: if through positive engagement and online activity your PDV reaches PDV: <br><br>
            1.0001   I   DEC: 1.0000  <br><br>
            then a real-world-value, $10 purchase will “cost” you (underwritten by Dec/Decentr) $9.9990, and so forth. (Simple math but on a global scale it changes the game completely.)
</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. So Decentr will be state-of-the art in security terms?</h3>
          <p>Yes – in fact, by default. The only way our data economy can function is by ensuring the value of every data point is 100% secure/decentralised, so our users know for a fact that we have to keep reinvesting in this aspect or our economy starts to falter. We need 100% anonymity and security for this to work.</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. Can you share the technicals of the Decentr anonymity layer? Not needing a VPN will be bomb!</h3>
          <p>The simplest way to describe it is we are using nodes in blockchain (Holochain) to connect to the actual data provider so there is no possible way it can be blocked – so no need for a VPN. And even TOR is not that secure – there is a huge hole in it because at some point a Russian government agency, with the help of hackers, managed to demonise certain people – and you can be pretty certain many other state-backed agencies would have no (and have not had any) qualms about taking similar action.</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. Why would the founders care about security? You’ll be making a mint from advertising!</h3>
          <p>Incorrect. There is no advertising on our site (and never will be) as successful “advertising” requires a pseudo-centralised system to harvest data and “target” potential customers. Certainly, companies who build solutions on our platform can leverage their data through great content and offer cheaper goods and services (if they choose) to consumers. On that basis, you can volunteer information if you would like to receive more about a company’s products and services. But that is up to you and not the company as regards how you would like to interact with them. Again, our only source of “value” is your source of “value” – the 100% protection of user data.</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. What is your relationship with Holochain? They are not mentioned specifically on your site.</h3>
          <p>That is true. Holochain is critical to Decentr as Holochain delivers the core foundational tech we need for 100% decentralised, energy-efficient data storage and other features we require. Holochain is the only technology that can deliver what we need as Holochain is not really blockchain per se: the updating of information on Holochain is not system-wide but user-centric, which is why it is the only suitable solution for Web 3.0. Holochain is not mentioned by name in the main site details (though we are quite vocal in the media about this partnership) as not everyone is aware of Holochain yet, so we stuck to using the term “DLT”, of which Holochain is a radically-new type, in order not to confuse a wider audience. (Holonauts will “get it” anyway!)</p>
<br><br>
          <h3>Q. So your web browser add-on will connect Holochain to hApps and dApps?</h3>
          <p>Yes. But Decentr goes much further than this. In our view, add-ons are a mediocre bridging solution – to change the world requires more radical solutions. We are actually not only building an add-on but also our very own Dec Browser (dBrowser), so no “piggybacking” on Chrome or Firefox but instead our own dBrowser based on Holochain. The dBrowser will be part of our software bundle that can be installed on any device – be that a smartphone or PC, or even your fridge with smart IoT capability. The possibilities are near-limitless: our devs are building a browser for all computers – be that Mac Linux or windows – and our mobile guys are doing the same for iOS and Android, so we cover all the systems that people use.</p>
